Ultratype is a lightweight library for creating split text animations. It differs from other animation libraries because it acts only as a splitter of sorts. What this means is that it does no animating own its own, rather it splits the text and gives each element __css custom properties__ that can be referenced in css. One of the main purposes of Ultratype is to leverage the cascade and power of modern css.
